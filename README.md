# Ruby Drills

Do these exercises over and over to build your Ruby Muscles!

### Instructions

Use your resources (ruby-docs and google) to determine which methods to use and how to accomplish your task.

You'll be working with a test file. Write your code in the space indicated to try to get the test to pass. Do not change any code outside of the space where you are to place your code. There are many ways to achieve the expected results, try to focus on the documented methods in the category of data you're working on. Ruby String docs for strings, Ruby Array docs for arrays, etc.

Example:
```
    def test_example
        greeting = "hello there"
        #-----and code here-------

        actual = greeting.capitalize

        #--------------------------
        expected = "Hello there"
        assert_equal expected, actual
    end
```

### Installing

Once you've forked and cloned this repo, run `bundle`.

To run the tests, type:
`ruby <directory_name/file_name>`
For example if I was working on strings/level_one.rb, I would run
`ruby strings/level_one.rb`.
